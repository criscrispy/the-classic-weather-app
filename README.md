# Project : the-classic-weather-app

This project is inspired by Joey Lee's **["the-weather-here"](https://github.com/joeyklee/the-weather-here)** app.

## Description
The app first prompts you to "check-in", then serves you the weather info based on your location. \
Upon clicking submit, your approximate latitude and logitude information is plotted on leaflet map.\ 
You can view your checkins and weather info on the leaflet map by click on the link to the logs page. \

You can also overide your geolocation information from your browser dev tools. Refresh the page to allow \
the app to set a log point in the leaflet js \
